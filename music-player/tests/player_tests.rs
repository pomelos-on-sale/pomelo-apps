//! The player's own tests: what the controls do, through the widget tree.
//!
//! Nothing here names a platform layer, reads a panel or draws a pixel. `iced_test`'s simulator
//! builds the *real* widget tree, finds a control by the label it is drawn with, presses it, and
//! hands back the message that produced. What the player costs the board — frames, damage, a finger
//! on the button — is asserted in `firmware/panel-tests`, where the panel is.
//!
//! The track these tests play is generated into a directory of the test's own. The repository's
//! `assets/music` holds a user's music, and a suite that passes only because those files happen to
//! be there is testing the checkout, not the player.
