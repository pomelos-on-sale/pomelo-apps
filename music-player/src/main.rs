//! The music player, as a program you can run.

//! ```text
//! cargo run                      # from this directory: iced's real `iced_winit`, and a window
//! ```

//! The board is the HAL's desktop simulator: this project is a player with no hardware behind it,
//! which is the point of the model being separate from the widgets. The firmware is what injects
//! the ESP32-S3 board instead — see the crate documentation.
