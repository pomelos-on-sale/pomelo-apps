//! The settings app's own tests: what the pages say, through the widget tree.
//!
//! Nothing here names a platform layer, reads a panel or draws a pixel. `iced_test`'s simulator
//! builds the *real* widget tree, finds a control by the text it is drawn with, presses it, and
//! hands back the message that produced. What the app costs the board — frames, damage, a finger
//! on the panel, a scroll — is asserted in `firmware/panel-tests`, where the panel is.

// These tests apply messages by hand, and a test has no loop to return the `Task` an update
// produces to. What that task does — send the page body back to the top — is the loop's business,
// not the state's. See `Settings::update`.
