//! The settings app, built from iced widgets — **a standard iced program**.
//!
//! A port of the settings app this replaces: the same section list, the same grouped cards and
//! the same switches, rebuilt from `iced`'s own widgets.
//!
//! Two decisions in the port are deliberate and worth stating before the code.
//!
//! # The labels are bilingual
//!
//! The interface speaks Simplified Chinese and English, and the language is part of the app's
//! state ([`Language`]): a switch is a state change, and iced's own diff repaints only the rows
//! whose text actually changed. [`i18n`] says why this is a static table and an exhaustive `match`
//! rather than `rust-i18n` or `fluent`.
//!
//! Chinese is the default, because it is the original: this app is a port of a Chinese settings
//! app, and its labels were **only** ASCII because the old 16 KiB Latin subset could not draw a
//! CJK glyph at all. The font carries 4008 Chinese characters now (see
//! `vendor/iced-pomelo-winit/fonts/README.md`), so the originals are back, with the English port
//! kept as the second language.
//!
//! What is translated is the interface: sections, row labels, switches, buttons, footnotes, and
//! the words in values (`未连接`, `已用`). What is not translated is **data** — a network's name, an
//! IP, a MAC, byte counts, a model number, a time. Those are facts about this machine, and the
//! pages below still write them as literals.
//!
//! # The board is injected, and the Wi-Fi page is why
//!
//! The app is handed an `Arc<pomelo_hal::Board>` by whoever builds it — the launcher passes the one
//! it already shares with every app it hosts, and `main.rs` builds the desktop simulator — which is
//! the same shape `music-player` uses. The port deliberately took no board, because every page it
//! had was a *reading*: a battery percentage is served by [`Settings::set_battery`], which the
//! platform pushes into, and a pushed value is testable with nothing but a widget tree.
//!
//! Wi-Fi is not a reading. Scanning and connecting are a conversation — the page asks the radio
//! (`Board::wifi().scan_start()`), waits, and asks again — and a push-only channel would put that
//! conversation in the *launcher*, which is the one thing hosting an app as a widget exists to
//! avoid. So the board is here, and so is the polling ([`Settings::subscription`]).
//!
//! The battery page still takes its number from the platform: a reading the platform owns stays
//! pushed, and nothing here reads `board.power()`.
//!
//! # Scrolling
//!
//! Every page is a 44px navigation bar plus an `iced_widget::scrollable` body, so a page taller
//! than the panel scrolls. Switching pages opens the new page at the top: the body is one
//! `scrollable` with one id, and [`Settings::update`] sends it `operation::snap_to` when the page
//! under it changes. The widget that used to do this (`page.rs`) existed only because this platform
//! could not run a widget operation at all; it can now, so the reset is iced's own.
