//! The "hello" signature, drawn through iced's canvas — **a standard iced program**.
//!
//! A port of the app that used to live in this directory, which drew it with the framework this
//! repository no longer has. Everything that is not about a framework — the curves, the canonical
//! size, the rainbow and where it runs — is the same data, and it is [`artwork`]; what differed was
//! the vocabulary. The original was a `CustomPainter` holding a pixmap it accumulated the stroke
//! into; this one is a [`canvas::Program`] that states the stroke as geometry and lets the renderer
//! work out what changed.
//!
//! That difference is the point of the port, and it is measurable. A canvas frame adds the pieces
//! that are already finished as *equal* commands, so the recorded renderer's damage diff pairs them
//! with themselves and reports only the piece still growing; the original had to keep its own pixmap
//! and repaint the tip into it by hand. The one thing this port gives up is the background
//! dithering, which `canvas` has nowhere to put: see the canvas module.
//!
//! # The clock
//!
//! [`Hello::subscription`] is the clock: while the animation is running it subscribes to
//! `iced::window::frames()`, which iced has and this board answers, so the same program animates in
//! a window and on the panel. Each message carries the `Instant` the platform read when it drew that
//! frame, and the animation is a function of it — so the app never reads a clock of its own, and a
//! frame that arrives late moves the animation further instead of being lost.
//!
//! Two consequences of stating it as a subscription instead of as "am I animating":
//!
//! * the cycle starts on the **first frame after the app is told to run**, not when it is built. A
//!   launcher builds this app at boot and opens it when a finger arrives, which can be minutes
//!   later; a clock started at construction would be over before the signature was ever on screen
//!   (that is exactly what the board showed: a pale wash, no stroke, for as long as the app was
//!   open);
//! * the subscription is *empty* once the animation has finished, so a finished signature costs
//!   nothing: no frames, no damage, no wakeups. That is what the host's `is_animating` used to say,
//!   and now the app says it by answering nothing.
