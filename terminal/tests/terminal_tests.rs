//! The terminal's own tests: what typing does, through the widget tree.
//!
//! Nothing here names a platform layer, reads a panel or draws a pixel. `iced_test`'s simulator
//! builds the *real* widget tree, finds a key by the label it is drawn with, presses it, and hands
//! back the message that produced. What the terminal costs the board — frames, damage, a finger on
//! the keyboard — is asserted in `firmware/panel-tests`, where the panel is.
