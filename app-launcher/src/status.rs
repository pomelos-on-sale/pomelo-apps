//! The status bar: the clock on the left, the signal and the battery on the right.
//!
//! Three readings dynamically driven by [`Subscription`](iced::Subscription), and
//! two of them are drawn as **icons** out of `pomelo_material_symbols` rather than as shapes of this
//! file's own: a bar chart of four rectangles said "signal" only because the launcher drew one, while
//! [`Icon::WIFI_2_BAR`] is a picture everyone has already seen. The clock stays text, because a
//! number is what it is.
//!
//! # Four bars of signal, three pictures of it
//!
//! `pomelo_hal::signal_bars` answers on a `0..=4` scale — four thresholds ten dBm apart, which is
//! about as finely as an RSSI can honestly be divided — and Material Symbols stops at three bars. So
//! `n` bars draw the `n`-bar icon and the fourth draws the third's picture: the difference between
//! −50 and −60 dBm is not something a 20 px glyph can show, and a picture that overstated the signal
//! would be worse than one that stops at "strong". The settings app's list is where four steps are
//! drawn as four.
//!
//! # Eight pictures of a battery
//!
//! `battery_android_0` through `_6`, then `_full`: seven steps of about fourteen percent each, and a
//! full battery as its own picture. The icon is the whole reading — the same as the signal, and for
//! the same reason: a percentage printed beside a picture of the percentage would be one reading
//! drawn twice, and eight steps are what a 20 px glyph can say.
//!
//! # The row is inset, and the band is not
//!
//! The panel's corners are round ([`style::STATUS_INSET`]): the bar's *black* reaches both edges —
//! it is the top of the display — while what is drawn on it stops short of the corners.
