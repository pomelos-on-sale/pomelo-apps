//! The launcher, built from iced widgets — **a standard iced program**.
//!
//! Deliberately free of raster images: iced's `image` feature pulls the `image` crate into the
//! firmware, and the wallpaper and icons we already bake are RGB565 blits that `pomelo-gfx` does
//! natively. So the wallpaper is a gradient and every picture on the screen is a glyph out of
//! `pomelo_material_symbols` — the grid's on an accent square, the status bar's on its black band —
//! one font of the whole Material Symbols catalogue, which costs nothing beyond the text this
//! launcher draws anyway.
//!
//! # Hosting an app is merging its subscription
//!
//! The six apps are hosted as **widgets**: this launcher calls their `view` and `update` itself, so
//! their state is its state. What a widget cannot carry is an app's *subscriptions* — the two that
//! animate (`hello`, `music-player`) and the one whose *layout* follows the screen (`terminal`) all
//! express that as a `Subscription`, and a subscription belongs to whoever owns the loop.
//!
//! So the launcher, which owns the loop for its children as far as they are concerned, says in
//! [`Launcher::subscription`] which of them is alive: the one on screen, and nothing else. That is
//! the declarative form of "only the app you are looking at animates" — off screen, an app is not
//! subscribed, so it costs no frames at all.
//!
//! # The screen's size is the platform's to know
//!
//! Nothing here may assume what size it is drawing into: the grid's pages, the pager's thresholds
//! and the terminal's band are all the screen's size, and the screen is a window on a desktop and a
//! panel on the board. So the launcher subscribes to `window::resize_events()` *always* — it is an
//! event and not a clock, so it costs no frames while nothing changes — and hands what it hears to
//! the hosted app whose layout depends on it ([`Launcher::hand_over_size`]). An app opened later was
//! not on screen when the platform announced the size at boot, which is why the hand-off exists at
//! all.
//!
//! # Where the board comes from
//!
//! [`program`] takes the board its apps share, and that board is the composition root's: the
//! firmware injects the ESP32-S3 one, this project's `main.rs` the HAL's desktop simulator. Nothing
//! here decides which hardware this is — the same argument as the music player's.
//!
//! # The grid is paged, and the pager is this file's
//!
//! A page is [`PER_PAGE`] apps, one to a quadrant, so the six the catalogue has are two pages. A
//! finger turning one is a **drag**: down on the grid, across, up. iced has no widget for that — a
//! `button` captures the press it is given, and `Scrollable` scrolls for a wheel, a touch or its own
//! scrollbar and for nothing else — so the gesture is read here.
//!
//! The drag decides a turn and the finger leaving *is* the turn: past halfway the page changes, and
//! short of it nothing moved. There is no slide, for the same reason there is never a second page on
//! screen: a page that slid would need two pages and the frames to move them, and a page change here
//! is one frame — the one after the release.
//!
//! Key layout notes:
//!
//! * a page evenly distributes apps across rows and columns using flexible spaces;
//! * only the app's icon is the pressable touch target, leaving surrounding spaces for pager swipe gestures.
